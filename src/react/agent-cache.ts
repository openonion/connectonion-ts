/**
 * @purpose Keep RemoteAgent WebSocket connections alive across session switches.
 *
 * Without this, useAgentForHuman created a fresh RemoteAgent (and a fresh WebSocket)
 * for every (address, sessionId) and dropped it on switch — so every session switch
 * tore the connection down and reconnected, flashing "disconnected"/"reconnecting"
 * and stranding a running session's live stream.
 *
 * This module caches the live RemoteAgent per (address, sessionId). Switching away
 * leaves the connection open in the background (it keeps receiving events and PONGing
 * the server's keepalive PING); switching back reuses the same instance, so there is
 * no reconnect. Bounded LRU (Map insertion order = recency): the most-recently-used
 * MAX_LIVE_AGENTS stay connected, older ones are closed. The active session is always
 * the most-recently-used, so it is never the one evicted.
