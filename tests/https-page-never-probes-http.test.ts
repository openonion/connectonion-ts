/**
 * What a page served over HTTPS is allowed to probe.
 *
 * An agent publishes every address it can be reached at, and the resolver walks
 * them looking for one that answers. Written for a CLI, that list is sensible:
 * localhost first, then the LAN, then the public IP — nearest wins.
 *
 * In a browser it means something else. `localhost` is the *visitor's* machine,
 * not the agent's. And from an https:// page every http:// candidate is dead on
 * arrival: the browser blocks it as mixed content before the request leaves.
 *
 * Observed on chat.openonion.ai, on every single page load:
 *
 *   http://localhost:8001/info        net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
 *   http://10.152.0.16:8001/info      blocked: mixed-content
 *   http://34.151.137.226:8001/info   blocked: mixed-content
 *
 * Three guaranteed failures, two console errors, one port scan of the reader's
 * own machine, and the relay fallback delayed behind all of it.
